- Show Name: CEHv10 (312-50)
- Topic Name: Introduction
- Episode Name: Intro to Ethical Hacking: Security Controls Pt.3
- Description: In this episode, Daniel and Zach continue their discussion of
Security Policies by discussing Physical Security. This includes physical threats
and physical controls that could be implemented to mitigate those threats. They
then move on to exploring Risk Management and Threat Modeling.

      + Hot-site backup
  + Look for ways you can implement Physical Security Controls
- Risk Management
  + What is Risk?
    - The adverse unknown
    - The probability that unwanted event can and will occur
      + Risk Matrix (DIAGRAM)
  + Risk Management Phases (DIAGRAM)
    - Identification
      + Internal and External
    - Assessment
    - Treatment
      + Implement proper controls to mitigate
    - Tracking
      + Makes sure controls are being implemented
      + Makes sure controls aren't creating any new risks
    - Review
      + Checks the effectiveness of the implemented controls

    - Process (DIAGRAM)
      + Identify Objectives
        - What are you trying to achieve
        - How much time and effort will it take to achieve
      + Application Overview
        - Laying out all aspects of a system
          + Elements/Components
          + Data/Data flows
          + Security mechanisms
          + Trust boundaries
      + Decompose Application
        - Deep dive into the system
        - Can uncover more threats
