- Topic Name: Information Gathering and Vulnerability Identification
- Episode Name: Vulnerability Analysis Concepts
- Description: In this episode, Daniel and Zach explore concepts that pertain to
performing a Vulnerability Assessment. Here they will discuss the difference
between a vulnerability scan and a penetration test as well as take you through
the Vulnerability Management Life-Cycle which defines the steps taken during the
Pre-assessment, Assessment, and Post-Assessment phases.

Vulnerability Analysis Concepts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ **What is a vulnerability assessment and how does it differ from a Penetration
  test?**
  - Only looks to discover vulns
    + Categorize them
      - OS vuln
      - Configuration issues
      - Patch management
      - App vuln
    + Prioritize mitigation
  - Pentests attempt to exploit vulns
+ **What types of vulnerability assessments should we be aware of?**
  - External
  - Internal
  - Web App/Application
  - Network/Wireless
+ **How do we begin preparing for a Vulnerability Assessment?**
  - We have to understand the Vulnerability Management life cycle
    + DIAGRAM
      - Baselines/Pre-assessment
        + Learn the client's business
          - What kind of business are they?
          - How do they operate?
          - What security controls are in place already?
        + Scope
          - Define what apps, devices, services, data are in scope
        + Scheduling
          - When can you perform assessment?
+ **Now that we have the pre-assessment phase squared away, what can we expect in
  the actual assessment phase?**
  - Depends on what controls, processes, apps, services, etc that are in scope
    + Scan for known vulnerabilities in...
      - Apps/Web Apps
      - OS
    + Scan for misconfigurations
    + Physical site security
  - Once you have those results...
    + Prioritize vulns
    + Contextualize to stakeholders how vulns could impact their business
      - In a way they will understand
        + Written and/or Verbal reports
          - Validation may be required
+ **Now that we've performed our vulnerability assessment and we have all these
  vulnerabilities, how do we handle that information?**
  - Perform post-assessment activities
    + Engage in Risk Assessment
      - Determine threat, risk, and impact levels
    + Remediate
      - Prioritize
      - Develop mitigation strategy
      - Perform mitigations
      - After action report
      - Develop processes/procedures/training to prevent future risk
    + Verification
      - Check to see that mitigations are effective
    + Monitoring
      - IDS/IPS
      - Ensure processes/procedures/policies/controls are being adhered to
